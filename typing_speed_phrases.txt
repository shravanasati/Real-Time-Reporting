there's no such thing as free lunch
throw caution to the wind
you cannot have your cake and eat it too
how does that sound
that sounds great
better late than never
speak of the devil
once in a blue moon
you cannot judge a book by its cover
to feel under the weather
a piece of cake
let the cat out of the bag
call it a day
getting a taste of your own medicine
the last straw
at the eleventh hour
a blessing in disguise
bite the bullet
time flies when you're having fun
your guess is as good as mine
